## Contributing
### Submitting an Issue
* No matter how minimal the issue or nice to have is, SUBMIT IT! Lets make this theme shiney and bug free!
* Please follow the issue template when submitting.

### Submitting a Pull Request
#### Editing style: 
* Only file you need to modify is the Theme.css file.
* Use Prettier as a css formatter with vscode.
   * Tab Width set to 4.
* [Optional] Enable github action in forked repository to automaticly generate test files in the PR branch, which can be easily installed into stylus and speed up testing.

#### Keep it simple and minimal: 
* Changing a class style can cause unwanted changes in other places due to github's terrible css practices. Doing simple and minimal changes ensures changes can be easily tracked and identified when reviewing.
* Keep format fixes seperate from style changes when commiting so the reviewer can easily identify what has been changed to the theme.
* Provide screenshots to capture whats changed so the reviewer can get an idea of what has been changed before looking through the commit.
* Your contribution may not be accepted if the reviewer deems so. Keeping it minimal ensures you dont waste a lot of time! If you think your change could have a chance of being declined, submit an issue instead!
