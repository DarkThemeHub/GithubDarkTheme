## Why isnt it in the chrome extension store?
Seems like chrome team thinks my extension has no icons, description and its suspicious. They would not further expand on it, instead just copy-paste me the same generic crap when i informed them its there and asking for a further explanation on whats suspicious.

So the google extensions team go suck one with their copy paste crap. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
